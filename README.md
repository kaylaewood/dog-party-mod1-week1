# Week 1 Project: Dog Party

For my first independent project at Turing, I created a webpage with some Javascript functionality based on a design comp. I have only been in class for five days and am proud of the product I have created.

Here is the comp I was given:

Here is the mobile-friendly version (based on iPhone 5 screen size):

The website has two Javascript functionalities:
1. When the user inputs a name into the text box, the title of the page will change to say, "A Site About [INPUT]."
2. When the user clicks on the "How," "What," and "Facts" buttons, the text above each button will disappear. The text will reappear when the button is clicked again.
3. When the use hovers over the navigation links at the top of the page, tooltips appear.
